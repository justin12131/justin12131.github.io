             <h4 class="intro"> Introduction</h4>
        </div>
             <p class="para1">The utility I will be reviewing is CCleaner. This utility was made on September 23, 2003. It was created by the developer Priform. CCleaner was initially released on the Windows operating system and was later brought to IOS. This utility was created to clean unwanted files and invalid windows registry to clear out storage space for computers.</p>

        <h4 class="general"> General Usage</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="para2"> The general usage of CCleaner as I explained in the intro is mainly used for deleting files that are not needed on your computer. There are different levels of the utility you are able to get. If you are willing to pay for it then you will gain access to other features like cleaning everything on your computer or file recovery that the free version does not have.</p>
