        Hi there its Justin! I am a student attending Douglas College. The program I am currently enrolled in is CSIS (Computer Studies and Information Systems) which started in the fall semester of 2019. I cant say that I am well versed in the world of programming, but I am very interested in pursuing this field nonetheless. Computers have always been near me ever since I was a young boy and I was always fascinated of everything digital. Questions like: what do people do to make a video game work?or, how are all these websites we see on the internet created? come to my mind all the time. Ever since I started this program up until today, Im always excited to see what else I can learn in this subject. As I dive deeper in the immersive world of coding, I hope to be able to create many things like other programmers have created.
